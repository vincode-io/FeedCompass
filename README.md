# Feed Compass

Feed Compass is a macOS application that makes it easier to find and subscribe
to RSS Feeds in your favorite RSS Reader.  It is a companion app to an RSS
Reader so you will need one of those to make Feed Compass usable.

There are lots of Mac RSS Readers available in the Mac App Store.  If you are
looking for a good, free RSS Reader we recommend 
[NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/).

It is currently in development, but is usable right now.  You can download it
here: [Feed Compass Download](http://vincode.io/Feed%20Compass.app.zip)
